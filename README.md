# Data_cleaning_project_with_mySQL
This project focuses on practicing and demonstrating advanced SQL data cleaning and manipulation skills.


## Project Goals: 
To significantly improve the quality and consistency of the datasets. project tracking database by addressing missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and correcting inconsistent entries. This prepares the data for accurate analysis.


## Data Source:
**Source:** Simulated project tracking database for TechSolutions Ltd, a fictional company specializing in developing software products and services.


### Dataset Condition:
The dataset is "dirty" due to internal mismanagement and inconsistent data collection methods. It contains a significant amount of inconsistent and missing data.  

Number of rows: 1800 rows  
Number of columns: 10 columns 


 ### Dataset Columns Description:
 1. project_id – ID of the project
 2. project_name – Name of the project
 3. start_date – Date when the project started
 4. end_date – Date when the project was completed (nullable)
 5. project_manager – Name of the project manager

## Results and Impact: 
* This project serves as proof of proficiency in essential SQL functions.
* The Data cleaning process provided a platform to know my data better, its quirks, flows and mysteries
* This project helps to provide cleaned data that is ready for analysis and provides value to the data given.
* Cleaning the data also ensure accurate insights that lead to a better decison making.
